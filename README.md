# 🦋 Dart Programming Portfolio

A comprehensive collection of Dart scripts designed to demonstrate both **fundamental** and **advanced** programming skills — from syntax and console I/O to OOP design, data structures, and algorithmic logic.

This repository is structured to provide clear, demonstrable proof of technical proficiency and coding versatility for reviewers, recruiters, and collaborators.

## 📂 Repository Overview

The codebase is organized into directories representing a natural progression — from basic Dart syntax to advanced utilities and algorithms.

### 1. 🧩 [Dart Basics](./Dart_Basics)
Covers fundamental syntax: Basic I/O, type casting, arrow syntax, conditional logic, and essential string utilities (`startsWith`, `toLowerCase`, Title Case).

### 2. 💬 [Console I/O](./Console_IO)
Demonstrates reading from `stdin` and writing to `stdout`, including input validation, parsing, and string manipulation for terminal-based interactions.

### 3. ➗ [Math and Conversions](./Math_And_Conversions)
Includes small, focused programs performing arithmetic operations, geometric calculations, and number conversions.

### 4. 🔁 [Control Flow Logic](./Control_Flow_Logic)
Explores advanced flow control with switch statements, range validation, and structured exception handling (`try/catch`, `throw Exception`).

### 5. 🧱 [Object-Oriented Programming](./Object_Oriented_Programming)
Implements core OOP concepts:
* Class definition and inheritance (`extends`)
* Getters and setters for encapsulation
* Custom constructors and class collaboration (e.g., Shopping Cart model)

### 6. ⚙️ [Advanced Concepts](./Advanced_Concepts)
Dives into collections, `map()` / `filter()` utilities, and advanced string operations for clean and expressive data transformations.

### 7. 🧮 [Advanced Algorithms](./Advanced_Algorithms)
Implements classical algorithms (Euclidean GCD, prime checking) and proof-of-concept utilities like text compression and decompression.

## ✨ Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Encapsulation:** Clear separation of data and behavior (`Car`, `Rectangle`)
- **Inheritance:** Subclassing via `extends` and constructor reuse with `super()`
- **Accessors:** Controlled access using getters/setters (e.g., masked phone numbers)
- **Collaboration:** Interacting classes (`Product`, `ShoppingCart`) modeling real-world logic

### 🛡️ Robustness & Flow Control
- **Exception Handling:** Custom error handling in CLI programs (`try/catch`, `throw`)
- **Efficiency:** Early exit patterns to avoid unnecessary loops
- **CLI Arguments:** Command-line parsing via `main(List<String> arguments)`

### 🧩 Data Structures & Collections
- **Advanced Iteration:** Manipulation of nested maps (`Map<String, List<int>>`)
- **Set Operations:** Using `Set` for uniqueness checks (e.g., hashtag extraction)
