# DART-Portofolio

# ðŸš€ Dart Programming Portfolio
A comprehensive collection of well-structured Dart scripts designed to showcase proficiency in fundamental syntax, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), advanced data structures, and algorithmic logic.

The repository is organized to provide clear, demonstrable evidence of competency to technical reviewers and hiring managers.

# The code is categorized into logical directories, representing a progression from core concepts to complex algorithms and utilities:

1. [Dart Basics](./Dart_Basics)
Basic I/O, Type Casting, Arrow Syntax, Conditional Logic, and essential String utilities (startsWith, toLowerCase, Title Case).

2. [Console I/O](./Console_IO)
This folder contains examples demonstrating basic console input and output operations in Dart. The programs show how to use stdin, stdout, and string manipulation to read user input and display results in the terminal.

3. [Math And Conversions](./Math_And_Conversions)
This folder includes a few basic Dart programs focused on simple math operations and fundamental programming concepts.

4. [Control Flow Logic](./Control_Flow_Logic)
Complex switch statements, if/else if range checking, Exception Handling (try-catch, throw Exception), and efficient validation (e.g., Early Return).

5. [OOP Principles & Modeling](./Object_Oriented_Programming) 
Class definition, Inheritance (extends), Getters/Setters (Accessors), Custom Constructors, and Multi-Class Collaboration (e.g., Shopping Cart Model).

6. [Advanced Concepts](./Advanced_Concepts)
This folder contains Dart programs that explore more advanced programming concepts such as collections, mapping, filtering, and string utilities.

7. [Advanced Algorithms](./Advanced_Algorithms)
Implementation of classical algorithms (e.g., Euclidean Algorithm for GCD, Primality Testing), and complex text processing schemes (e.g., Text Compression/Decompression POC).

# âœ¨ Primary Concepts Demonstrated

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Encapsulation
Clear separation of object properties and behavior (Car, Rectangle).

### Inheritance
Implementing the Student class that extends Person and utilizes super() for parent constructor calls.

### Accessors
Use of Getters and Setters to control read/write access and apply validation/formatting (e.g., masking phone numbers).

### Collaboration
Modeling the interaction between the Product and ShoppingCart classes to aggregate data and apply business logic (discounts).


## Robustness and Control Flow

### Exception Handling
Implementing try-catch blocks and throw Exception within custom functions (e.g., CLI Calculator, Roman Numeral Converter) to ensure application stability.

### Efficieny
Utilizing Early Exit/Return for optimized list validation, minimizing unnecessary iterations.

### CLI Arguments
Processing command-line input directly from the main(List<String> arguments) list.


## Data Structures & Collections

### Advanced Iteration
Nested looping and in-place modification of complex structures like Map<String, List<int>>.

### Set Usage
Leveraging the inherent uniqueness of the Set data type for tasks like extracting unique hashtags.
